        <p>
            I am a digital artist with a passion for creativity and technology. 
            I enjoy working on illustrations and exploring new artistic techniques. 
            Currently, I am studying programming to expand my skill set and integrate art with technology.

        <p>
            I aspire to create and design RPG games, combining storytelling and interactive experiences. 
            Additionally, I want to develop websites for clients, as web development allows me to explore both 
            creativity and technical skills. Since design plays a crucial role in both fields, I find it exciting 
            to merge my artistic background with programming!
