        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a digital artist with a passion for creativity and technology.</p>
        <p> I enjoy working on illustrations and exploring new artistic techniques.</p>
        <p> Currently, I am studying programming to expand my skill set and integrate art with technology.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> I aspire to create and design RPG games, combining storytelling and interactive experiences.</p> 
        <p> Additionally, I want to develop websites for clients, as web development allows me to explore both</p> 
        <p> creativity and technical skills. Since design plays a crucial role in both fields, I find it exciting 
        <p> to merge my artistic background with programming!</p>
